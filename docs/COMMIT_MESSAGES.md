feat: Major refactoring - Add 4 new clients, reduce code duplication, enhance UX

- Add common functions library (lib/common_functions.sh) to eliminate code duplication
- Add 4 new client installation scripts:
  * Nethermind (execution) - Enterprise .NET client  
  * Besu (execution) - Java client for public/private networks
  * Teku (consensus) - Java client for institutional use
  * Nimbus (consensus) - Lightweight, resource-efficient client
  * Lodestar (consensus) - TypeScript, developer-friendly client  
  * Grandine (consensus) - High-performance Rust client
- Add interactive client selection assistant (select_clients.sh)
- Refactor install_geth.sh to use common functions
- Comprehensive README.md update with client comparisons and troubleshooting
- Improve client diversity support from 3 to 11 total clients (5 execution + 6 consensus)

BREAKING CHANGE: None - fully backward compatible
