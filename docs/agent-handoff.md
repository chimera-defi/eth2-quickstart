## Latest Update
- Date: 2026-03-05
- Author: codex
- Summary:
  - Added a canonical systemd service registry and service lifecycle helpers in `lib/common_functions.sh`.
  - Restored missing utility behavior by implementing `start_all_services`, `restart_all_services`, and `show_service_status`.
  - Fixed service-name consistency: standardized runtime checks on `mev` unit name (not `mev-boost`).
  - Improved `install/utils/doctor.sh` to report both MEV-Boost (`mev`) and Commit-Boost services.
  - Added unified wrapper `scripts/eth2qs.sh` as a stable command entrypoint for humans and AI agents.
  - Added machine-readable health output in `install/utils/doctor.sh --json` while keeping human-readable output as default.
  - Reworked `install/utils/update.sh` path handling and version reporting to use correct repo/home paths.
  - Expanded purge service coverage by using canonical service list in `install/utils/purge_ethereum_data.sh`.
  - Updated docs (`README.md`, `docs/SCRIPTS.md`, `install/utils/README_UPDATE_SCRIPTS.md`) with canonical service references and helper usage.
  - Added regression tests for service consistency:
    - `install/test/test_common_functions.sh` now validates service registry contents, helper existence, MEV stack precedence, and doctor unit-name checks.
    - `test/ci_test_run_2.sh` now verifies newly added service helpers and MEV service naming consistency.
- Validation:
  - `bash -n` passed for all touched utility/core scripts.
  - `install/utils/start.sh` runs successfully.
  - `install/utils/refresh.sh` runs successfully.
  - `install/utils/stats.sh` runs successfully.
  - `./test/run_tests.sh --full` passed (276/276).
  - `USE_MOCKS=true bash install/test/test_common_functions.sh` passed.
  - `bash test/ci_test_run_1.sh` passed.
  - `./scripts/eth2qs.sh doctor --json | python3 -m json.tool >/dev/null` passed.
  - `bash test/ci_test_run_2.sh` passed as non-root user in a writable copy under `/tmp`.
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider exposing `scripts/eth2qs.sh` as `eth2qs` in release artifacts for global PATH usage.
  - Add a dedicated helper script to run `ci_test_run_2.sh` non-root in environments where repo is under `/root` (permission boundary).
  - Optionally add a machine-readable service manifest for CI drift checks between code and docs.
